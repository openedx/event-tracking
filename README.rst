event-tracking
==============

This is a system for tracking events.  It is designed to support pluggable
backends for persisting the event data. When the application emits an event
each backend will be given an opportunity to save the event to stable storage.

Roadmap
-------

In the very near future the following features are planned:

* Layered contexts - allowing data to be injected into events even without
  having to pass around all of said data to every location where the events
  are emitted.
* Django integration - provide a Django app that allows events to easily be
  captured by web applications.
* Dynamic documentation and event metadata - allow event emitters to document
  the event types, and persist this documentation along with the events so
  that it can be referenced during analysis to provide context about what
  the event is and when it is emitted.


Documentation
-------------

Initial API docs can be found in the ``doc`` directory.
