event-tracking
==============

Track context-aware semi-structured system events.  Capture and store events
with nested data structures in order to truly take advantage of schemaless
data storage systems.

Key features:

* Multiple backends - define custom backends that can be used to persist
  your event data.
* Nested contexts - allows data to be injected into events even without
  having to pass around all of said data to every location where the events
  are emitted.
* Django integration - provides a Django app that allows context aware events
  to easily be captured by multi-threaded web applications.
* MongoDB integration - support writing events out to a mongo collection.

Example::

    from eventtracking import tracker

    tracker = tracker.get_tracker()
    tracker.enter_context('outer', {'user_id': 10938})
    tracker.emit('navigation.request', {'url': 'http://www.edx.org/some/path/1'})

    with tracker.context({'user_id': 11111, 'session_id': '2987lkjdyoioey'}):
        tracker.emit('navigation.request', {'url': 'http://www.edx.org/some/path/2'})

    tracker.emit(
        'address.create',
        {
            'name': 'foo',
            'address': {
                'postal_code': '90210',
                'country': 'United States'
            }
        }
    )

Running the above example produces the following events::

    {
        "name": "navigation.request",
        "timestamp": ...,
        "context": {
            "user_id": 10938
        },
        "data": {
            "url": "http://www.edx.org/some/path/1"
        }
    },
    {
        "name": "navigation.request",
        "timestamp": ...,
        "context": {
            "user_id": 11111,
            "session_id": "2987lkjdyoioey"
        },
        "data": {
            "url": "http://www.edx.org/some/path/2"
        }
    },    
    {
        "name": "navigation.request",
        "timestamp": ...,
        "context": {
            "user_id": 10938
        },
        "data": {
            "name": "foo",
            "address": {
                "postal_code": "90210",
                "country": "United States"
            }
        }
    }


Build Status

    :target: https://travis-ci.org/edx/event-tracking


Roadmap
-------

In the very near future the following features are planned:

* Dynamic event documentation and event metadata - allow event emitters to
  document the event types, and persist this documentation along with the
  events so that it can be referenced during analysis to provide context
  about what the event is and when it is emitted.


Documentation
-------------

Documentation is hosted on `read the docs <http://www.readthedocs.org/>`_.

Releases:

* `development <http://event-tracking.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_
