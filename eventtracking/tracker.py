"""
Track application events.  Supports persisting events to multiple backends.

Best Practices:
* It is recommended that event types are namespaced using dot notation to
    avoid naming collisions, similar to DNS names.  For example:
    org.edx.video.stop, edu.mit.audio.stop
* Avoid using event type names that may cause collisions.  The burden is
    on the analyst to decide whether your event is equivalent to another
    and should be grouped accordingly etc.
* Do not emit events that you don't own.  This could negatively impact
    the analysis of the event stream.  If you suspect your event is
    equivalent to another, say so in your documenation, and the analyst
    can decide whether or not to group them.
